    <h1 id="introd">We are known for :</h1>
    <p id="introd">Papa John's story began in 1984 when John Schnatter, the founder, sold his beloved 1971 Camaro to fund his dream of making better pizza. He used the money to purchase used restaurant equipment, setting up shop in a broom closet in his father's tavern in Jeffersonville, Indiana. From that modest space, he started crafting pizzas with a focus on high-quality ingredients and fresh dough.

        His dedication to quality quickly gained popularity, and within a year, Papa John's opened its first official restaurant. As the brand expanded, it became known for its signature phrase, "Better Ingredients, Better Pizza," reflecting its commitment to superior taste and quality. Over the years, Papa John's has grown into one of the largest pizza chains globally, with thousands of stores in numerous countries, but it has never lost its focus on delivering fresh, high-quality pizzas to its customers.</p>
